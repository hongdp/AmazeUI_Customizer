# The Next
---

Future plan of Amaze UI can be seen from our [development road map](https://github.com/allmobilize/amazeui/wiki/Roadmap). We will keep updating this wiki.

If you like our concept, please send your idea and suggestion to us.

- **Developed for modern browsers**；
- **Developed based on browsers**：Besides those common UIs, we will do something based on HTML5 APIs of browsers, **But** We will not add implementation such as charts to Amaze UI, nor some third party libraries. Of course, we will organize some popular projects by different functionalities for web developers to use.
- **Develop for future**：We pay attention to the cut edge front-end web technologies, and will apply them to Amaze UI. For instance, we are considering supporting Angular.js, and we have already built Amaze UI React for React.js.
