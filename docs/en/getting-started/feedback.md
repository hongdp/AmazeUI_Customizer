## Common Questions?

### How to add images?

Insert images in GitHub Issue:

- **Drag image into the input box**, and the image will be uploaded and inserted into the content;
- you can also **copy paste image**.

If you want to add image to comment in our official website, please read next question.

### How to add image to comment box in the official website.

~~Image upload should be done with third party image host.~~

~~Click on **Insert Image** button, and replace `请输入图片地址` with your image URL.~~

鉴于开启 HTML 解析以后，用户粘贴的代码被解析了。现在禁用了，无法直接插入图片了，不过仍然可以使用下面的图床上传以后给出图片地址。
Currently we can't directly insert images, except using following image host:
