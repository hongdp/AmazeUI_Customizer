### Is it free?

MIT License, it's pretty clear. Amaze UI is totally FREE.

### Amaze UI don't have xx widget, is there any recommendation?

First, **make sure you have checked every link in the sidebar of every tab**. If your window is small, ** the sidebar can be scrollable**, click on the small arrow or use roller.

**Still can't find?** Then we really don't have it. Check [plugin collection](/getting-started/collections?_ver=2.x)

### 「爱上一匹野马，可你的家里没有草原…」？(Fall in love with a horse, but you don't own a prairie? It's just a lyric in Chinese with analogy. Don't think too much.)

Amaze UI 2.x rely on jQuery, Please import the latest version of jQuery before import Amaze UI.

### Sample codes don't work？

- Make sure you have already imported jQuery and the CSS and JS of Amaze UI. Replace `path/to/` with your path.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/css/amazeui.min.css"/>
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"></script>
<script src="path/to/js/amazeui.min.js"></script>
```

- If everything has been done, check version information in the head of CSS and JS files of Amaze UI.
